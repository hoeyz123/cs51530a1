     double int long char boolean
2) operator 
=   
+   -   *   /   
+=  -=  *=  /=  

3) integer literal

DecimalIntegerLiteral defined here 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-3.html#jls-DecimalIntegerLiteral 

4) double literal

one or more digits.[zero or more digits]

5) identifier
  a letter followed by sequence of digits or letter
  cannot be a keyword in 1)

 letter: a-z, or A-Z
 digits: 0-9
6) separators, one of 
;  , 

The program should read  a file, output the tokens on screen or file. Remember a token is pair including the lexeme and its type

Submit your source code, your test file, the output of your test file, your file should test all possible cases
